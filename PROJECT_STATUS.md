# langLSRW Project Status

Last updated: 2026-09-23

## Current Stage

langLSRW is currently a personal, local-first language-learning prototype. The listening and speaking workflow is usable for daily local testing. Reading, writing, review pools, article generation, and cloud data are still future work.

Local testing is the default workflow. Run `tools/start-langlsrw-server.bat` on Windows or `tools/start-langlsrw-server.sh` on Linux/Ubuntu, then open `http://localhost:8848/`. A Sites hosting configuration exists, but deployment must only happen after the owner explicitly requests it. `deploy/README.md` documents a separate, owner-requested deployment target: the `vpsde` VPS, served at `lang.mltz.tech`.

## Implemented

### Shared application

- Four-part navigation: `听说 -> 读 -> 写`; reading and writing currently remain placeholders.
- Local users, browser storage, user switching, JSON import/export, and settings reset.
- Four themes: black, gray, light, and eye-care.
- Separate English-content and Chinese UI/translation font settings.
- Configurable colors for all grammar roles, with a color picker, editable HEX value, common color palette, local persistence, and reset defaults.
- Top popovers for shortcuts, source files, settings, and users. Learning shortcuts are suspended while any of these popovers is open.
- Independent sentence-library dialog with library categories, search, paginated preview, and a direct practice action.
- Local static server launcher that resolves the project directory from the BAT file location and only stops a Python `http.server` occupying port 8848.

### Sentence libraries

- The first built-in package is `常用英语句库`, containing 30,150 English-Chinese pairs with stable source IDs.
- The package uses a small versioned `manifest.json` plus compact TSV content; it does not spend AI tokens classifying every sentence.
- English, Chinese, and ID search run locally after the package is loaded.
- Preview renders 50 records per page instead of creating 30,150 DOM rows.
- Selecting the package makes all 30,150 records available to the existing listening and speaking workflow.
- Scenario, grammar, level, and phrase library categories are reserved in the UI but remain disabled until content is added.

### Listening and dictation

- Import `.txt` and `.lrc`, paste sentence lists, and load the bundled bilingual material.
- English source above Chinese translation, with independent source and translation visibility.
- Ordered, random, and mistake practice modes.
- Previous/next sentence navigation, British English as the default accent, voice selection, normal and slower replay, word replay, and automatic reading.
- Dictation input with accuracy, speed, pause, fluency, and error statistics plus recent records.
- Configurable keyboard shortcuts.

### Speaking

- Hold-to-speak workflow with speech recognition and recording.
- Live bar-style volume indication and active-listening border feedback.
- Similarity, omitted-word, wrong-word, extra-word, and volume feedback.
- Recording playback and model-sentence comparison controls.

### AI grammar analysis

- Manual AI trigger; sentence switching and ordinary practice never trigger paid requests.
- Personal local API settings stored in browser storage for the current private-use stage.
- Traditional English teaching grammar is the only enabled runtime framework.
- Hierarchical grammar JSON rendering with main, first-level, and all-node views.
- Role-specific colors, expandable nodes, notes, child indicators, and explanations.
- Cached analysis reuse for the same sentence; reanalysis is an explicit context-menu action.
- View and copy the exact AI prompt and raw/formatted AI response.
- Prompt source is maintained in the traditional grammar Skill and generated into `src/generated/grammar-prompt.js`.
- SIEG2 remains a separate Skill and appears disabled in the UI; it is not included in the active runtime prompt.

## Current Architecture

```text
langLSRW/
  index.html
  src/
    app.js
    library.js
    styles.css
    generated/grammar-prompt.js
  assets/materials/default-bilingual.lrc
  assets/libraries/common-english-30150/
    manifest.json
    sentences.tsv
  tools/start-langlsrw-server.bat
  tools/start-langlsrw-server.sh
  .agents/skills/
    langlsrw-traditional-grammar-analysis/
    langlsrw-sieg2-grammar-analysis/
  .openai/hosting.json
```

The HTML, CSS, bundled material, generated prompt, and launcher are separated. Most application behavior is still concentrated in `src/app.js`; splitting listening, speaking, storage, settings, and grammar rendering into modules remains architectural work, not a completed migration.

## Known Boundaries

- Reading and writing pages are not implemented yet.
- AI article generation, writing review, and review-material generation are not implemented yet.
- Only the common sentence library is currently available; the other library categories have no data yet.
- There is no backend, authentication service, database, or cloud sync.
- The API key is stored in browser local storage and is acceptable only for private local use.
- Before public AI access, requests must move behind a backend proxy with quotas and cost controls.
- Speech recognition and recording depend on browser support and microphone permission.
- The native system color-picker dialog cannot be customized by the webpage; HEX editing is provided in the settings panel.

## Verification

Verified on 2026-09-23:

- `node --check src/app.js` passes.
- Traditional grammar Skill/runtime prompt synchronization test passes: 1/1.
- SIEG2 Skill validation and cache behavior tests pass: 13/13.
- Common grammar colors render correctly in black and gray themes.
- HEX input and common-palette selection update only the selected grammar role.
- Opening a top popover disables learning shortcuts; closing it restores them.
- The common library manifest count matches the 30,150 valid TSV records.
- Library search, 50-row pagination, practice selection, and shortcut suspension were verified in the browser.

## Next Priorities

1. Continue local daily-use testing and fix listening, speaking, and grammar-analysis defects.
2. Continue moving feature boundaries out of the large `src/app.js`; sentence-library loading already lives in `src/library.js`.
3. Build the reading page around full articles, sentence understanding, vocabulary, phrases, and notes.
4. Build the writing page around rewriting, summaries, retelling, and AI-assisted review.
5. Add review pools that connect listening mistakes, speaking problems, reading notes, and writing corrections.
6. Add AI-generated learning materials based on level and interests, using manual triggers, caching, and result reuse.
7. Add a backend proxy, authentication, quotas, and cloud storage only before broader public use.
